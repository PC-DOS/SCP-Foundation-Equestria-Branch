**Description:** SCP-EQ-202 is a an anomalous biological effect on Earth ponies (//Terra Equinothro//). 
Individuals effected by SCP-EQ-202 (hereafter referred to as SCP-EQ-202-1) will go through a series of biological and arcansiological changes, including but not limited to: 
* Decrease in body mass. The average body mass of SCP-EQ-202-1 is approximately 70% of common Earth ponies, which is slightly higher than pegasi (//Pegasum Equinothro//). 
* Toxicity resistance of chicory plants (//Lactuceae Cass.//). 
* Significant decrease of muscle tone, endurance and explosiveness. 
* Changes in skeletal structure, which forms [REDACTED PER //PROTOCOL VoR-202//] and increases flexibility significantly. 
* Changes in cerebral structure, [REDACTED PER //PROTOCOL VoR-202//]. The average EOIT[[footnote]]Equestrian Ordinary Intelligence Test. [[/footnote]] scores in Saptial Visualization and Memory are respectively 134.2 and 150.1[[footnote]]For reference, the average scores of mathematics undergraduates in Canterlot Royal University (L.E. 762) in the aforementioned two subjects are respectively 117.9 and 104.2. [[/footnote]]. 
(Details are displayed in supplementary File EQ-202-A02)
The method of propagation of SCP-EQ-202 is currently unconfirmed. Instances of SCP-EQ-202-1 make up --0.02%-- --0.94%-- --3.87%-- --16.54%-- 42.36% of the total population of Earth ponies. 
SCP-EQ-202-1, after a certain but undetermined point of changes, show anomalous magic abilities, including but not limited to: 
* Telekinetsis. 
* Generation of fluorescent illumination. 
* --Production of pathogens.-- (Determined as misrepresentation)
* Generation of --temporal-- nonpersistent saptial anomalies. 
(Details are displayed in supplementary File EQ-202-A03)

**Addendum EQ-202.1:** 
The gender ration (F:M) of instances of SCP-EQ-202 is 2.71:1, which is slightly higher than average of population (2.48:1).

@@      @@For hundreds of years, we have tried to explain SCP-EQ-202, to prevent it from spreading. Yet it has already changed ponykind; the abnormal appendage and ability that once was only seen on O5-1, at the moment of my writing this, has appeared on about one third of ponies. With a mere whip of their magical horns, they can put us in anxiety with ease. Not to mention some of the SCP-EQ-202-1, who have proved as dangerous as some high-hazard reality benders.

I once strenuously objected doing so, as I believed Foundation should fight against anomalies till the end instead of covering them.
